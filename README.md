## ðŸ“– Overview  
KinMind is an AI-powered system for automating attendance tracking and predicting student engagement in virtual classrooms.  
Inspired by Mayan concepts of time (*Kin* = "day" or "sun" in Yucatec Maya), KinMind merges ancient wisdom with modern data science to help educators understand and improve participation in online learning environments.  

This project was developed as part of the graduate course **GestiÃ³n de la EducaciÃ³n Virtual** (Universidad Nacional AutÃ³noma de Honduras, UNAH) and includes:  
- **Automated attendance extraction** from Zoom logs.  
- **Real-time engagement prediction** using machine learning.  
- **Data anonymization** for privacy protection.  
- **Open-source code** and **sample anonymized datasets**.

## Features  
- Extracts and processes Zoom connection logs.  
- Calculates total and average attendance times.  
- Predicts engagement using supervised ML models.  
- Generates visualizations for class participation trends.  
- Provides anonymized datasets for reproducibility.
